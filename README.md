# Sentiment-Analysis-Review

The purpose of this project is to use data analysis techniques like sentiment analysis, prediction modeling, and negative review clustering to analyze 20k hotel reviews extracted from Tripadvisor via Kaggle. 

The goal is to learn from the reviews, predict sentiment, identify key topics, and group similar 
negative reviews. The findings help the hotel industry improve customer satisfaction and 
decision-making processes.
